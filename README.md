1. Project Title
📣 Marketing Campaign Insights Dashboard - 
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze customer engagement and response to a bank’s marketing campaigns—focusing on demographics, product uptake, and campaign effectiveness.

2. 📌 Short Description / Purpose - 
The Marketing Campaign Insights Dashboard helps business users and analysts understand how different customer segments respond to marketing initiatives. It visualizes key campaign metrics such as conversion rates, customer profiles, and product interest, empowering data-driven decision-making.

3. 🛠️ Tech Stack
This dashboard was developed using the following technologies:

a.📊 Power BI Desktop – Core tool used for designing visuals and interactivity.

b.📂 Power Query – Used to clean and shape raw campaign and customer data.

c.🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For building measures such as response rates, customer retention, and segmentation logic.

d.📝 Data Modeling – Integrated customer and campaign data to form meaningful relationships and filters.

e.📁 File Format – .pbit Power BI Template File, allowing easy reuse with other datasets.

4.📈 Data Source - 
Source: Kaggle - Bank Marketing Dataset (insert link to your actual dataset)
The dataset includes detailed information about a bank's direct marketing campaigns targeting potential customers. It includes features such as age, job, marital status, education, loan status, previous contacts, and the final outcome (subscription to a term deposit).

5.✨ Features / Highlights - 
• Business Problem
Banks often run marketing campaigns without clearly identifying which segments convert best or how many follow-up attempts are effective. Without real-time feedback and analysis, marketing ROI drops, and customer fatigue rises.

• Goal of the Dashboard
To empower campaign managers with a clear, data-driven overview of:

Who is responding to campaigns and why.

Which customer groups are more likely to subscribe.

Which channels (phone calls, days of the week, contact duration) yield better performance.
